## RussellRollins dotfiles

Get a new computer in fighting shape.

## Instructions

While this repo seeks to automate as much of the install process as possible, not everything is easily automate-able.

### Clone this repo into ~/.dotfiles

If the new computer doesn't have git, install it manually.

### Software Not Installed via Homebrew

Some things are best installed the clicky-clicky way, much as I hate to admit it.

Do these first.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)

### Run setup

Now run the Setup script, which should take you the rest of a way to a happy computer.

```
./setup.sh
```
